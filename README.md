# AerobaticLogger
Project to log glider aerobatic flights for later replay and analysis, with a view to potential automatic live scoring. GPS time and location, IMU with minimum 9DOF, and barometric pressure for altitude. 

The logger we intend to use is provided by Gulf Coast Data Concepts. The project is sponsored by British Aerobatics.
